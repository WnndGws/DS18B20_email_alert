# DS18B20 Email Alert

This is a python script that can be run on a Rasberry Pi connected to a DS18B20 temperature sensor.
The script will run continuously, and when a temperature threshold is reached, will email a user.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
<++>

### Prerequisites

All code is run on the following system:
* A Rasberry Pi Zero W
* Rasbian Stretch Lite
* Python 3

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running
<++>

Say what the step will be
<++>

```
Give the example
<++>
```

And repeat
<++>

```
until finished
<++>
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
<++>

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
